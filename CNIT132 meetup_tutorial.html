  <h1>My Experience with the meetup lecture</h1>
  
<p>Upon attending the Meetup for learning how to use Chrome Dev Tools, I noticed 
    that I chose a good subject to learn. Hosted by Micah W. and Wes T., I was greatful for how 
    clear spoken and to the point they was. 
</p>
<p>I'm unsure about other lectures they did. I couldn't find them on the site. I learned how to inspect, how to use element selector, and add or edit 
    attributes for HTML, CSS, & Javascript. For each language they gave a walk through on how to use or find each tool.
    I also learned how to debug.
