<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm Monique. I am skilled in Web Development. Although I haven't<br> 
been in the field for too long. I have been a self taught individual who used other resources other than<br>
school to practice coding.</p>
<hr>
    <p>One of the sites that helped me learn how to code is W3 Tutorial and Free Code Camp.<br>
    W3 helps with looking up ways to use HTML and Javascript plus more. <br>
It explains each syntax for different types of code, and helps you practice.<br>
W3 is great, but my favorite is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank']2.01">freecodecamp.</a><br>
Free Code Camp helped me practice each step of syntax by beginner to expert level.<br>
They also give you a certificate after each different level of lessons for coding is complete.<br>
They are very straight to the point and each lesson is easy to understand, plus well organized.<br>
They also have a comunnity of other students, plus web developers that you can talk to and ask<br>
ask for help. Definitly my go to site.</p>
